    <p><b>I am a passionate programmer and highly enjoy problem solving. Making scalable, maintanable, and optimised software to be used and enjoyed by 
        others is a true love of mine.</b></p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I have been programming since I first discovered it at 13 years old. I went on to study programming in gymnasiet where I learned C# and HTML/CSS. 
        C# was my main language and had been since I started. I learned it alongside using the Unity game engine to make prototypes for games or just proofs 
        of concept. Feeling that I had found what I really wanted to do I continued this path into Malm√∂ University where I studied game development. During 
        this program I learned even more C# and Unity and also began using some new languages such as C++, Java, and SQL. C++ quickly became a favourite 
        alongside C# as I really like the low-level control it gives.</p>

    <h2>What I do</h2>
