            <p>This is a prototype for a couch co-op zombie game that was made during the Microsoft swedish Game Camp 2023. The objective is to survive for 
                as long as possible while taking out zombies. The way the players do this is by forcing them into a curing machine which will spit out a 
                fully cured scientist. Around the map are machines which help the players towards this objective ranging from repairable walls to a tesla coil.

            <p>This is a small scale game by two people meant to be the testbed for a third year bachelor's thesis. It is a 2D precision platformer meant to be 
                difficult while still obviously being fair. The game is split into distinct levels with the difficulty increasing as the game goes along. 
                Completing a level has the potential to give a medal if completed within a certain time.

            <p>This is a seven person group project, made during my third year of university. We made a combat-based top-down game where dodging is the player's 
                main way of avoiding damage. It was also decided that it would have an underwater motif taking place in a sunken city. The player controls a 
                diesel-punk diver while fighting undead zombie-like enemies who are equipped with 3 different weapon types. At the end of the demo is a boss fight 
                against a rock guardian.

            <p>This was my first group project in university where five of us decided to make a stealth game where you play as a pirate. The player has a cutlass 
                and pistol with limited ammunition, these two tools allow him to dispatch enemies by sneaking up behind them or engaging in open combat. While very 
                rudementary it taught me a lot about not only working with others using tools like github and YouTrack but also more generally about how to program 
                and structure projects for group work.

            <h2>Unnamed Tower Defence Game</h2>
            <img src="Tower Defence/Tower Defence Cover.jpg"/>

            <p>This was a solo project during my first year in University where I programmed a tower defence game in the Unity game engine for a course called 
                "Object-oriented game programming". The goal is to place towers around the map to halt the advcancement of enemies. There are four tower types 
                each of which has 3 updgrade tiers.
