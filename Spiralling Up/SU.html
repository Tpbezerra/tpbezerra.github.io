        <h1>Spiralling Up</h1>
        <p>This is a small scale game for a third year bachelor's project. The player makes their way through multiple levels trying to reach an end door. Throughout the level are 
            different traps: pits, spikes, sawblades, and cannons. The player avoids these by utilising precise movement and if they reach the end within certain times they recieve 
            medals. This being a testing game however, the player's time and death count are being recorded throughout their play session and compared against other players. The 
            purpose of this being to attempt to find how graphical fidelity affects a player's perception of the game's difficulty.
            <br/><br/>

        <h2>Contributions</h2>
        <p>This was mainly a two-man project however throughout it we got help by having an outside party make the sprites and textures. This left both of us with time to program and 
            design the gameplay, which is what we are good at.
        </p>

        <h2>The Player</h2>
        <p>The player controls a small robot which can move freely left and right as well as jump and wall jump. Moving has a small amount of momentum and jumping can be done with variable 
            height depending on when the player lets go of the jump button. The wall jump is done when the player is touching the wall and presses that same button. There are also small 
            mechanics present to aid the player such as input buffering.

        <h2>Levels</h2>
        <p>There are 6 main levels split into 1.1/1.2, 2.1/2.2, and 3.1/3.2 as well as three tutorial levels. The tutorials are designed to be easier than the rest in order to ease the 
            player into the game.
        </p>

        <img id="SectionImg" src="Spiralling Up Traps.jpg" align="left">
        <p>Spread along the map are traps which will kill the player on collision. The main types are spikes and sawblades.</p>

        <img id="SectionImg" src="Spiralling Up Bullets.jpg" align="left">
        <p>Another type of traps are cannons which fire bullets, these travel towards the position where the player is at the time of firing.</p>

        <img id="SectionImg" src="Spiralling Up Level End.jpg" align="left">
        <p>Reaching the end will display a pop-up with the player's time and number of attempts. Under this are the medals that they receive thanks to the time.</p>
