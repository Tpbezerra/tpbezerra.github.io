        <h1>The Aquanaut</h1>
        <p>This was a 3rd year university project during a course called "Game-engine driven product development" where groups of students were tasked with making a game from start to finish 
            with some form of constraint. Each group also got the opportunity to work with a music student from another program and a mentor from inside the industry. The constraint we were 
            given was that it had to be a 2D game, we therefore chose a top-down perspective. The game ended up being fun and is something I am ever proud of.</p>

        <h2>Contributions</h2>
        <p>For this project I was the lead programmer and did most of the programming, this means everything except for the main menu UI, settings, and the fish. I also did some modelling 
            and spent a lot of time on the design of the game. The code in this was written to be as scalable, maintainable, and testable as possible so as to easily fix bugs and add new 
            features.</p>

        <b>Modelling:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Weapons (2 swords, trident, harpoon, harpoon gun)</li>
            <li>Basic enemies (and their armour)</li>
            <li>Crystals (save- and healing crystals)</li>
            <li>Gate</li>
        </ul>
    
        <b>Design:</b>
        <p>The gameplay was mainly designed by me and one other member that worked on it to balance and make it fun. The in-game UI was a collaborative effort where I 
            would design something and then change it according to input.</p>

        <h2>The Player</h2>
        <p>The player has a few options at any given time, dodging, attacking with their sword, and shooting their harpoon. The dodge gives invulnerability frames for a part of it which helps 
            the player avoid damage. During an even smaller part of it is a deflect "window" where, if timed properly, the player can deal poise damage to the attacker while on the defensive.</p>
    
        <img id="SectionImg" src="The Aquanaut Heavy Harpoon.jpg" align="left">
        <p>There are two options when attacking, light- and heavy attacks. When attacking with the sword this means that different animations with alternate stats will play. Light and heavy 
            attacks can then be combined to perform chain attacks. When shooting a harpoon a light attack will root the target it hits while a heavy will stun it and anyone around but also costing 
            crystals to use. Crystals are also used for healing.</p>

        <img id="SectionImg" src="The Aquanaut Interaction.jpg" align="left">
        <p>When close to objects the player can interact with a prompt will appear telling the player that it is possible to do so.</p>

        <img id="SectionImg" src="The Aquanaut Recharging.jpg" align="left">
        <p>Large crystals will replenish the player's crystals and max out their health.</p>
        <br clear="left">

    <div class="ProjectSec">
        <h2>Enemies</h2>
        <p>Each enemy has a set of attacks that they can perform, these can then lead into other attacks for longer attack chains.</p>
    
        <img id="SectionImg" src="The Aquanaut Combat.jpg" align="left">
        <p>There are three types of enemy, a sword enemy with more sweeping and AOE attacks but lower range; a trident enemy with longer range but less area; and a harpoon thrower that tries to 
            stay away while attacking from range, when up close they can kick the player away.</p>
        <br clear="left">
        <br/>

        <img id="SectionImg" src="The Aquanaut Execution.jpg" align="left">
        <p>Attacking an enemy will increase their poise and deal slight damage to their health. Once their poise reaches its max value the enemy gets stunned and takes a lot more damage.</p>
        <br clear="left">
        <br/>
        
        <img id="SectionImg" src="The Aquanaut Dead Enemy.jpg" align="left">
        <p>When the enemies die they play a short animation before exploding into a puff of smoke, leaving only small trails behind.</p>
