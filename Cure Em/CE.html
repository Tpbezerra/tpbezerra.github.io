        <h1>Cure'Em</h1>
        <p>This was a prototype game for the Microsoft swedish Game Camp 2023 about curing zombies with friends. The idea came from the fact that all 
            group members really like couch co-op games where chaos thrives. The players will collaborate to pick up and stop funnel zombies into the 
            curing machine in order to get more workers.

        <h2>Contributions</h2>
        <p>For this project I did most of the programming as well as taking care of the GUI. The main goal while programming was modularity and 
            scalability. We knew that we would want a ton of possibilities when it came to interactables and functionality so making this process 
            easy was very important.
        </p>

        <h2>The Players</h2>
        <p>Movement is momentum-based and fairly quick so that players can control the zombies in the smoothest way possible. The players can 
            interact with gadgets around the map by walking inside their "interaction circles" and pressing a key. They can also pick up zombies, 
            doing so while standing in front of them will cause a quick-time event to pop up. Succeeding will pick up the zombie, failing will 
            stun the player.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="ProjectSec">
        <h2>The Zombies</h2>
        <p>These move very simply by following the player and breaking down potential obstacles in their way. When they get picked up they enter
            a ragdoll state and can be flung around (or into others), getting back up once released. By forcing the zombies into the "Cure 
            machine", they will transform into scientists and be thrown out.
